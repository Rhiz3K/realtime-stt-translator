# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch.

If you are running a deployed copy, consider pulling updates regularly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred:

- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting ("Report a vulnerability"), or
- Open a draft security advisory: [security/advisories/new](../../security/advisories/new)

If you cannot use a private channel, contact the maintainer via the GitHub
profile at https://github.com/Rhiz3K.

### What to Include

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept code is welcome)
- Affected endpoints/engines/configuration (Web Speech / Deepgram / ElevenLabs)
- Any relevant logs (redact secrets: API keys, auth cookies, passwords)

### Disclosure Process

- We will acknowledge receipt as soon as practical.
- We may ask for clarification or additional details.
- Once confirmed, we will work on a fix and publish an update.
